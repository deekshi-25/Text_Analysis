An environmental hazard refers to any element within the natural or man-made environment that poses a potential threat to human health and well-being, including physical dangers like extreme weather events, chemical pollutants in air and water, biological agents like bacteria and viruses, radiation exposure, and noise pollution. These hazards can manifest as acute health issues like respiratory problems from air pollution or chronic diseases linked to long-term exposure to toxic substances, highlighting the importance of environmental protection measures to mitigate risks and safeguard ecosystems.
